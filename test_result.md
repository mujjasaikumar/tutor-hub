# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  TutorHub password change modal bug fix. Students with temporary password (Student@123) must be forced to change their password on first login. The modal was not appearing because the backend Token model was missing the must_change_password field.

backend:
  - task: "Login endpoint returns must_change_password flag"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"

        comment: "Fixed Token model (line 80-84) to include must_change_password field. The login endpoint at line 400 already returns this field, but it was being filtered by Pydantic response validation."

        comment: "✅ TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: Login endpoint correctly returns must_change_password field. Test student (student@test.com) with must_change_password=true logs in successfully and response includes must_change_password: true in the JSON response along with access_token, token_type, and user object."

        comment: "✅ TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: Password change endpoint working correctly. Successfully changes password from 'Student@123' to 'NewPassword123', returns success message, and sets must_change_password to false.

    message: |
      Fixed the Token model to include must_change_password field. Please test the following scenarios:
      
      1. Create/verify a student user with must_change_password=true exists in database
      2. Test login with this student (email/password)
      3. Verify the response includes must_change_password: true
      4. Test the change-password endpoint with old password and new password
      5. Verify after password change, must_change_password is set to false
      6. Test login again to verify must_change_password is now false
      
      Use these credentials if they exist or create a test student:
      - Default temp password: Student@123
      - Test email: student@test.com or similar
  - agent: "testing"

      ✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED
      
      Comprehensive testing of password change modal flow completed successfully:
      
      🔍 TESTS PERFORMED:
      1. ✅ API Health Check - Backend accessible at https://tutorhub-3.preview.emergentagent.com/api
      2. ✅ Test Student Setup - Used existing student@test.com with must_change_password=true
      3. ✅ Login Response Test - Login returns correct JSON with must_change_password: true
      4. ✅ Password Change Success - Successfully changed from Student@123 to NewPassword123
      5. ✅ Login After Change - New password works, must_change_password now false
      6. ✅ Invalid Password Rejection - Correctly rejects wrong old password with 400 error
      
      🎯 KEY FINDINGS:
      - Token model fix is working correctly
      - Login endpoint properly returns must_change_password field
      - Password change endpoint validates old password and updates database
      - must_change_password flag is correctly reset to false after successful change
      - Error handling works properly for invalid credentials
